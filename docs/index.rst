Welcome to taruh's documentation!
=================================


**taruh** is an upcoming Python library currently in the planning phase, aimed at simplifying the construction and traversal of parallel trees for efficient algorithmic processing. Emphasizing the importance of simplicity in Python, **taruh** aims to provide developers with an intuitive and user-friendly API, allowing them to implement complex tree-based algorithms without dealing with low-level details such as CUDA or OpenCL. By abstracting away the complexities of parallel programming, **taruh** enables users to focus on the algorithmic logic, leveraging the power of GPUs or multi-core CPUs effortlessly. With its simplicity and ease of use, **taruh** aims to democratize parallel tree processing, making it accessible to a wider range of Python developers.

.. note::
      **taruh** is still in planning and early development stage.
